## Labs

### Lab 1 - WordCount

Introduction to Spark basics with the classic WordCount implementation.

### Lab 2 - SparkSQL and Dataframes

Manipulation of structured data with SparkSQL and Dataframes.

### Lab 3 - Data Engineering

Advanced Data Engineering techniques with Apache Spark.

---

## Final Project

The final project consists of two notebooks:

- **IMDB Analysis**: Data analysis from IMDB datasets (people, movies, ratings, etc.)
- **Streaming**: Real-time stream processing tracking Wikipedia edits for IMDB entities (Christopher Nolan, The Godfather, etc.) with alert system and metrics collection

> To run the notebooks, simply click "Run All".

---

## Technologies Used

- **Apache Spark** - Distributed processing framework
- **PySpark** - Python API for Spark
- **Jupyter Notebook** - Interactive development environment
- **SparkSQL** - Spark's SQL module
- **Spark Streaming** - Real-time data processing
